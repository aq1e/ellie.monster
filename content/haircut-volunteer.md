title: looking for haircut volunteers
---

I'm looking to become a barber. Looking for any lab rat volunteers in Toronto who would like a free haircut by me with no guarantee of quality. Perfect for those who have already bad hair that cannot be ruined by having me operating on it!

I only have experience in cutting short hair, I am learning how to do a fade. But I am happy to work with any hair style. 

<font color="grey">Do I have a portfolio you ask? I will, once I cut **your hair**. </font>

If you are interested, please [email me](mailto:me@ellie.monster)
